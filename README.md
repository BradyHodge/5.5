#### Opening page
> Welcome to Breath 5.5!

Discover the power of balanced breathing with our guided 5.5-second breath technique. By inhaling for 5.5 seconds and exhaling for 5.5 seconds, you can achieve a state known as "coherent breathing." This method is proven to enhance mental clarity, reduce stress, and improve overall well-being.

Why 5.5 Seconds?
Mental Clarity: This breathing pattern optimizes blood flow to the brain, promoting mental clarity and reducing anxiety. It helps synchronize the heart, brain, and nervous system, leading to better cognitive function and a calmer state of mind.

Ancient Practice, Modern Science: The 5.5-second technique mirrors rhythms found in traditional practices like Buddhist mantras, Christian prayers, and yoga, validated by modern research for their calming effects.

Health Benefits: Regular practice can lower blood pressure, reduce stress, and enhance lung capacity, offering a simple way to improve physical and mental health.

Easy to Practice: Start with just 5 minutes a day and experience the benefits. Learn to stop over-breathing and try something better.
